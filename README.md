# Birthday Gift Idea Generator

A Python script that generates unique, personalized birthday gift ideas using the OpenAI API. This tool is designed to help users find the perfect gift for any individual by customizing suggestions based on the recipient's interests, age, relationship to the giver, budget, and more.

## Features

- **Personalized Gift Suggestions**: Get creative and thoughtful gift ideas tailored to the recipient’s preferences.
- **Customizable**: Enter details like recipient’s name, age, interests, relationship, and budget to get the best possible gift ideas.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate unique suggestions based on user input.
- **Interactive**: User-friendly interface that allows you to input recipient information and receive customized ideas instantly.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenAI API key (You'll need to create an account on OpenAI and generate an API key)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/birthday-gift-idea-generator.git
   cd birthday-gift-idea-generator
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:

   Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, you can install the necessary library directly:

   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

3. **Set up your OpenAI API key**:

   - Create an `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key as follows:

     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
     ```

   - Alternatively, you can directly add your API key to the script by replacing `os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")` with your key.

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed and your OpenAI API key is set up, you can run the script as follows:

1. **Run the Python script**:

   ```bash
   python gift_idea_generator.py
   ```

2. **Input the required details**:

   The script will prompt you for the following details:
   
   - **Recipient's Name**: Enter the name of the person you're buying a gift for.
   - **Age**: Enter the recipient's age.
   - **Gender**: Enter the recipient's gender (male/female/other).
   - **Interests**: Enter a comma-separated list of interests (e.g., "gaming, cooking, photography").
   - **Relationship**: Enter your relationship to the recipient (e.g., "friend, sibling, partner").
   - **Budget**: Enter the budget for the gift (e.g., "under $50", "luxury").
   - **Personalized Message (Optional)**: Enter any specific message or special request for the gift.

3. **View the generated gift ideas**:

   The script will return a list of unique and creative gift suggestions based on the inputs you provide.

## Example Output

```bash
Enter the recipient's name: John
Enter the recipient's age: 30
Enter the recipient's gender (male/female/other): male
Enter the recipient's interests (comma-separated, e.g., gaming, cooking): photography, hiking, travel
Enter your relationship to the recipient (friend, partner, sibling, etc.): friend
Enter your budget for the gift (e.g., under $50, luxury, etc.): under $100
Enter any specific requirements or message for the gift (optional): Something thoughtful for a friend who loves nature.

Here are some unique birthday gift ideas:

1. A high-quality portable camera tripod for his outdoor photography trips.
2. A custom-designed hiking backpack that’s both functional and stylish.
3. A travel journal with a leather-bound cover where he can document his trips.
4. A portable solar-powered charger to keep his devices charged during hikes and travels.
5. A nature-themed puzzle featuring breathtaking landscapes.
6. A photography workshop with a professional photographer to elevate his skills.
7. A personalized compass engraved with a meaningful quote for his hiking adventures.
```

## Customizing the Script

You can easily modify the script to generate more detailed suggestions or adjust the input parameters. The `get_gift_ideas()` function in `gift_idea_generator.py` can be adjusted to make the prompt more specific to your needs.
